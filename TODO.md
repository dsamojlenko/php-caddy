# TODO
- provide instructions for installing/configuring php
- replace HiddenConsole with https://github.com/kohsuke/winsw (?)
- use http://localtest.me/ for wildcard subdomain support
- allow multiple site links?
  - `caddy link` and `caddy links`
- `caddy restart` command (just an alias to `caddy start`?)
- `caddy package` to package up the current site in a self-contained server pack?  (how to deal with php/mysql?)

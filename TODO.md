# TODO
- ~~`caddy install` to install binaries to ~/.phpcaddy directory so upgrading doesn't require stopping services~~ 
- replace HiddenConsole with https://github.com/kohsuke/winsw (?)
- use http://localtest.me/ for wildcard subdomain support
- allow multiple site links
  - `caddy link` and `caddy links`
- ~~change commands to `caddy start` and `caddy stop`~~
- make Mailhog optional at startup and allow to be individually controlled, ie: `caddy service mailhog start/stop`
- provide instructions for installing/configuring php
- `caddy restart` command (just an alias to `caddy start`?)
- allow custom drivers

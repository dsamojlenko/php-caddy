# TODO
- Track binaries versions
- provide instructions for installing/configuring php
- Optionally include/download pre-configured portable PHP? `caddy install --with-php`
- replace HiddenConsole with https://github.com/kohsuke/winsw (?)
- use http://localtest.me/ for wildcard subdomain support? and support multiple sites?
- `caddy restart` command (just an alias to `caddy start`?)
- `caddy package` to package up the current site in a self-contained server pack?  (need portable php, mysql)
- updating links with opcache enabled errors
